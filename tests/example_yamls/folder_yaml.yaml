# We implement three categories of Looker user groups:
#
# 1. Roles: these groups are assigned Looker Roles, which control what
#    functionality a user has access to in Looker.
# 2. Content: these groups control access to Folders, which organize
#    content (dashboards and Looks) in Looker.
# 3. Attributes: these groups are assigned attributes, which are used to
#    control access to rows and columns of data via access filters and
#    access frants.
